= Function Controller

== Purpose
The *function controller* runs inside kubernetes and continuously monitors the *function* and *topic* custom resource
definitions for changes. It then reacts by requesting the deployment of functions, and scales them according to new
events being detected on their input topics.

== Development
=== Prerequisites
The following tools are required to build this project:

- `make`
- Docker
- https://github.com/Masterminds/glide#install[Glide] for dependency management
- https://github.com/vektra/mockery#installation[Mockery] if you need to re-generate mocks used for tests

=== Get the source
[source, bash]
====
cd $(go env GOPATH)   #defaults to ~/go
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/function-controller src/github.com/projectriff/function-controller
====

=== Building
* To build locally (this will produce a binary named `function-controller` on _your_ machine):
+
[source, bash]
====
make build
====

* To build for docker (and deploy as part of the whole https://github.com/projectriff/riff#-manual-install-of-riff[riff]
installation):
+
[source, bash]
====
make dockerize
====
This assumes that your docker client is correctly configured to target the daemon where you want the image built.

* To run tests:
+
[source, bash]
====
make test
====
